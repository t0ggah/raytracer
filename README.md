# RayTracing in One Weekend

## Concept

Building a RayTracer in Rust with help from this tutorial: [RayTracingInOneWeekend](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html)

## Todo

- [x] Output an image
- [x] Add Vec3 struct
- [x] Add Ray struct
- [ ] ...

## Images

First section outputs an image and this was the result:

![First image](/images/first_image.png)

Second part adds Ray which creates an image with a "linear blend":

![Second image](/images/second_image.png)

Third part colors a sphere red:

![Third image](/images/third_image.png)

Fourth part colors a sphere to its normal vectors:

![Fourth image](/images/fourth_image.png)

Fifth part adds hittable objects and draws to sphere's on image
