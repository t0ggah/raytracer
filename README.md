# RayTracing in One Weekend

## Concept

Building a RayTracer in Rust with help from this tutorial: [RayTracingInOneWeekend](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html)

## Todo

- [x] Output an image
- [ ] Add Vec3 struct
- [ ] Add Ray struct
- [ ] ...

## Images

First section outputs an image and this was the result:

![First image](/images/first_image.png)

Second part adds Ray which creates an image with a "linear blend":

![Second image](/images/second_image.png)
