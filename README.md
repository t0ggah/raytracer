# RayTracing in One Weekend

## Concept

Building a RayTracer in Rust with help from this tutorial: [RayTracingInOneWeekend](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html)

## Images

First section outputs an image and this was the result:

![First image](/images/first_image.png)

Second part adds Ray which creates an image with a "linear blend":

![Second image](/images/second_image.png)

Third part colors a sphere red:

![Third image](/images/third_image.png)

Fourth part colors a sphere to its normal vectors:

![Fourth image](/images/fourth_image.png)

Fifth part adds hittable objects and draws to sphere's on image

![Fifth image](/images/fifth_image.png)

Sixth part adds antialising to the edges of the objects

![Sixth image](/images/sixth_image.png)

Seventh part renders a diffuse sphere

![Seventh image](/images/seventh_image.png)

Eight part does a gamma correction to the diffuse sphere

![Eight image](/images/eight_image.png)

Ninth part adds hemisperical scattering to the diffuse sphere

![Ninth image](/images/ninth_image.png)

Tenth part adds material to sphere

![Tenth image](/images/tenth_image.png)

Eleventh part adds dielectric material

![Eleventh image](/images/eleventh_image.png)

Twelveth part changes camera position and orientation

![Twelveth image - 1](/images/twelveth_image_1.png)
![Twelveth image - 2](/images/twelveth_image_2.png)

Thirteenth part spheres with depth of field

![Thirteenth image](/images/thirteenth_image.png)

Last part creates a random scene of spheres
